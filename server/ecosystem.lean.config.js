/**
 * LEAN profile — for a single small EC2 box (t2.micro / t3.small).
 *
 *     pm2 delete all
 *     pm2 start ecosystem.lean.config.js
 *     pm2 save && pm2 startup
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ---------------
 * ecosystem.config.js runs 8 separate processes (~900MB). That buys isolation, but
 * it will OOM a 1-2GB box. Here the API keeps hosting the four hot workers
 * in-process (RUN_INLINE_WORKERS defaults to true) — exactly what it always did —
 * and we only add dedicated processes for the three that were NEVER running:
 * dlq, payments and retention.
 *
 *   4 processes, ~400MB, and nothing is silently missing.
 *
 * Trade-off vs the full profile: a crash in the dispatch/notifications/stale/shield
 * worker restarts the API with it. For a single-node deployment that is an
 * acceptable price; move to ecosystem.config.js once you outgrow one box.

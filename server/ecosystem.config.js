/**
 * PM2 process definitions for EC2 (single-node production).
 *
 * Run everything:
 *     cd server
 *     pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
 *     pm2 save && pm2 startup     # survive an EC2 reboot
 *
 * Why this file exists
 * --------------------
 * `npm start` alone runs the API *plus* dispatch/notifications/stale/shield
 * IN-PROCESS — but NOT the dlq, payments or retention workers. That meant, in
 * production:
 *   - dlq + payments never ran, so the auto-refund pipeline was dead: a customer
 *     who paid and never got a worker was NEVER refunded, and support was never
 *     alerted.
 *   - retention never ran, so "service due" reminders never fired.
 *
 * Here the API runs with RUN_INLINE_WORKERS=false and every worker is its own
 * supervised process, so nothing is silently missing and one crashing worker
 * cannot take the API down with it.
 *
 * Useful:
 *   pm2 status                 # what's alive
 *   pm2 logs zappy-dispatch    # tail one worker
 *   pm2 restart zappy-dispatch # after a deploy
 *   pm2 restart all
